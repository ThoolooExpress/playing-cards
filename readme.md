Playing Cards Detection
========================

Forked so that I could resize images and still have them hosted on github. All images are the same as lordloh's repo, thank him for providing them.  
This is mainly for my personal experimentation, so I may add and remove various sizes somewhat randomly.  If you'd like to have control over which
sizes of images are available for your use, please fork the repo, and use the rescale.py script to create a new set formatted however you'd like.

## Original ReadMe

This is a Dataset of Playing card images indented for image processing projects to detect and classify the cards by Rank ([0-9AQJK]) and Suite (Hearts, Spades, Diamond, Clubs, [Wild]).

If you are using this dataset, please cite this repository. Should you publish your code online, please create a support request with a link to your repository. I shall compile a list in this file.
